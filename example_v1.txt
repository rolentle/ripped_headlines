Law and Order follows Lt. Olivia Benson and Sgt. Elliot Stabler of the New York City police department as they solve a heinous crime. The two detectives discover that a school shooting has occurred at Belleview Elementary School in the heart of Manhattan, leaving eight children and a security guard dead.

Further investigation reveals their prime suspect is a prominent scientist at Elinz Pharmaceuticals, who has recently made a breakthrough in experimenting and developing treatments for Alzheimer's disease. Benson and Stabler soon uncover a possible motive, as it appears the suspect was seeking revenge against the school for a personal conflict. As the detectives narrow in on the suspect, evidence begins to point towards a larger conspiracy when the scientists mind-controlled and coerced into committing the massacre. Will Benson and Stabler be able to bring the killer to justice before more innocent people are hurt?
